# High-Perform-Switches-Router
Syllabus of EL7373 High Performance Switches and Routers (2015 Fall)
Course Description
High-performance large-scale routers and switches are key network components to realize
todayâ€™s Internet, datacenters, cloud computing, and IT (information technology) infrastructure.
They also determine the quality of service of various services, such as content search, video
streaming and multimedia conference calls. On the other hand, large-scale network intrusion
attacks have become commonly recurring events that threaten the proper functioning and
continual success of the IT infrastructure and services. One key aspect of mitigating such
increasing threats is to implement intrusion detection, prevention and access control at the
switches or routers.
This course first covers the basics, architectures, and technologies to implement IP routers and
Ethernet switches. It discusses the fundamental concepts and algorithms to implement packet
forwarding, packet classification, and packet switching. Topics include IP Route Lookup, Packet
Classification, Packet Scheduling, Buffer Management, Basics of Packet Switching, Outputbuffered
Switches, Shared-memory Switches, Input-buffered Switches, Clos-network Switches,
and Multi-Stage Buffered Switches. The course will then cover the architectures and algorithms
to implement high-performance intrusion detection that can scale with the line speed and the
volume of attack patterns.
