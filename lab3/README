1. The example code, str_match_file.c, contains an example of naive string matching algorithm.

2. Please compile str_match_file.c using the following command:
   g++ -o naive.out str_match_file.c
   
3. Usage of naive.out:
   ./naive.out [file name of text] [file name of pattern]
   
4. Your codes should be able to print out:
   - Each matching position.
   - Total number of (possibly overlapped) matches.
   - Total number of character comparisons.
   - Total execution time of string matching algorithm.
